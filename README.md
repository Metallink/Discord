# Discord-like
University project that consists in coding a chat application using Websockets and an API Rest. 
This project is no quite complete as we only had 2.5 week to deliver something. I intend to get back to it as soon as I can. 

# Front-end
I put more effort on that part as I was focused on discovering and practicing AngularJS. 
I spent more time trying different stuff and was actually more in the mood of learning this framework.

# Back-end
For the back-end, I first start to implement the server side using Java but then I decided to use the Spring framework which was more difficult than i expected.
I will come back to that part later in my freetime and will choose to start over using Node.js. That way I will have a JS fullstack application.

# Database
We also had to implement a DB. I first used JPA then changed my mind to use MongoDB. 
I will also start over this part using Firebase as a complement to AngularJS.
